Online Team Collaboration service
The OTC service allows team members to collaborate together using
discussion-like channels. The service provides two main types of communications between team members. The first
are public channels, where each subscribed user can write and read messages into the channelâ€™s discussion. The
second are private channels used by two users to communicate with each other in a private manner.
